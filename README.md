# Constructor-Word-Guess
Advanced JavaScript Constructor Word Guess using Nodejs

This Nodejs app uses the inquirer and prompt npm packages to construct a Word Guess Game using Nodejs. 

It also uses the "cli-color" npm package to add color to the game, the "figlet" npm package to convert the text into a drawing, the 
"is-letter" npm package to validate the users entry to determine if the value entered by the user is a letter or not, and the "boxen" npm  package to display boxes in the terminal.
